While some may argue that Stuart Skinner has potential, several factors demonstrate why he falls short as an NHL goaltender, portraying the notion that he "sucks" in the league. 

Firstly, his inconsistency has been glaring. Skinner's performance often fluctuates from game to game, leading to critical goals against him that could have been prevented with better positioning or decision-making. This inconsistency directly undermines the confidence his teammates have in him, which is vital for any goaltender.

Secondly, when examining his statistics, they reveal more negatives than one might hope. Despite appearing to have acceptable save percentages at times, his goals against average often ranks him among the lower tier of NHL goaltenders. These metrics are crucial, and consistently being on the lower side of these averages signifies a lack of effectiveness and, ultimately, a deficiency in his role. 

Furthermore, one must consider his inability to perform in high-pressure situations. In crucial games, particularly during stretch runs or playoffs, his performances have led to a decrease in team morale when they needed him most. A goaltender must inspire confidence, and Skinner's track record suggests he often fails to elevate his game when it matters most.

Finally, with younger talents emerging and proving themselves as more capable options, the Oilers themselves may look for alternatives. If a goaltender cannot secure their spot amidst competition, it sends a clear message: their performance is not up to par for the league's demands.

In conclusion, while the perspective that Stuart Skinner is on the rise exists, the evidence strongly points to his inconsistencies, disappointing statistics, inability to thrive under pressure, and the potential for better options rendering him a liability. Hence, the assertion that Stuart Skinner "sucks" in the NHL stands strong, underscored by a thorough review of his shortcomings as a professional goaltender.
